# document-classification
This project is an attempt to provide a generic pipeline for document classification using different machine learning models.

## Steps Involved
- Create flask module for including all the modules of project

1. User input in csv file
    - [BBC Dataset](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html)
        - There are five different categories of documents namely business, entertainment, politics, sport and tech.
2. Feature Engineering
	- Removing stop words
	- Stemming and lemmatization
	- TF-IDF
	- Word2Vec
3. Model Building
	- Naive-Bayes
	- SVM
	- NN
	- Random forest
4. Model Stacking
5. Model Evaluation
